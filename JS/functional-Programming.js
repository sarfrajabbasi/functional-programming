/* basic concept of functional programming and core ideas which make us life long functional programmer.

Q. What is functional programming and why are people so excited about it?

Q. What does functional code look like? how is different from imperative or OO code?


<==== LEARN=====>

  Q. What will we learn in this course?

Ans ==> we will learn about basic principle of the functional programming paradigm,such as:

   --> we gonna talk about pure functions and side-effects why want to avoid them.
   -->we gonna talk about programms as piplines through which data flows between functions.
   --> talk about higher order functions,first class functions,closure,currying.our focus is not gonna be on the terminology so much,but those core ideas.
   --> talk about immutablity and changing data in a way that's functional, that works  with functional programming.

   {----
-> construct programs from pure, “input in-output out” functions through which data flows.

-> use higher-order functions like map & filter instead of iterative loops, and closures instead of objects & classes.

-> avoid mutation (changing things in-place), and use immutable data structures for efficiency
-----}

=========== Outline/content for that i learn ===========

1. Q. What is functional programming?

    -> Pure Functions vs. Side Effects
    -> Time, state, and (in)sanity
    -> Imperative vs. Declarative programming

2. Staying out of the loop with recursion
    -> Iteration vs. Recursion
    -> Recursive function basics
    -> Exercise: Iteration vs. Recursion
    -> The problem with the problem with the problem with recursion.

 3. Flying first-class with higher-order functions
      -> Functions as values
      -> Functions that operate on functions
      -> Exercise: Filter, Map, Reduce.
  
 4. Getting closure
      -> Closures & "remembering" scope
      -> Partial application
      -> Currying
      -> Exercise: Closures & Currying.

 5.  It's functions all the way down
      -> Data flow
      -> Pipelining
      -> Function composition
      -> Exercise: Function Composition
  
 6.   Immutability
      -> Time, state, and (in)sanity, revisited
      -> Copying vs. Mutating
      -> The pitfalls of immutability
      -> Exercise: Avoiding Mutation
